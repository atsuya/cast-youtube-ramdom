cast youtube videos in random from a specific youtube channel.

## status

it seems like there is no official way to cast a youtube video to youtube cast receiver from non-youtube app.

my current compromise is to create a playlist with videos randomly picked from a given youtube channel, and cast the playlist from youtube app. not an ideal solution, but it gets the job done.
